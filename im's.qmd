## Introduction
Compound interest is a crucial concept in finance, representing interest calculated on both the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. Understanding compound interest is fundamental for financial planning and investment decisions.

## Formula
The compound interest formula is given by:

\[ A = P \times (1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} \]

- \(A\): Amount after \(n\) years
- \(P\): Principal amount
- \(r\): Annual interest rate (decimal)
- \(n\): Number of times interest is compounded per year
- \(t\): Time in years

## Examples
### Example 1:
Let's say you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded quarterly for 3 years. The calculation would be:

\[ A = 1000 \times (1 + \frac{0.05}{4})^{4 \times 3} \]

### Example 2:
...

## Implementation
### Python
```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, time, comp_per_year):
    return principal * (1 + rate/comp_per_year)**(comp_per_year*time)

# Example usage
p = 1000
r = 0.05
t = 3
n = 4
result = compound_interest(p, r, t, n)
print(f"Compound Interest: ${result:.2f}")
